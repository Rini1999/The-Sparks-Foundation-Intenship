## TASK 1
### Predicted the percentage of a student to be 92.915 if he/she studied for 9.25 hours a day using supervised machine learning. Here, I used a simple linear regression model as it involves just two variables.

## TASK 2 
### Predicted the optimum number of clusters to be 3 and represented it visually from iris dataset using unsupervised machine learning. Here, I used k-means clustering to find the optimum number of clusters.
